## Introduction

SEO tools is an easy to use collection of... SEO tools!

SEO is a high demand field and SEO professionals always rely on tools to run
basic to more advanced tasks. Some of them are:
- Getting all the metadata and SEO on page element of a webpage
- Getting all the headings of a webpage
- Getting the schema mark up of a webpage
- Get a list of internal links of a webpage
- much more...

These information are used to assess whether or not something needs to be 
optimised.

A quick search with Google Keywords Planner can reveal how manu monthly searches
there are for 'SEO tools'.

![SEO tools search volumes](./README-files/seo-tools-search-volume.png)

And this is only for the exact match keyword. 

Think about all of the alternatives and synonyms.

### Who is SEO Tools for?
SEO professionals looking for an easy to use suit of SEO tools.

### What SEO tools offer:
A webpage scraper able to:
- get all of the most important on page elements.
- get all the headings of a page with related tag.
- get the schema markup of a page.
- get a list of all the links on the webpage.

## User Experience (UX) - user stories
Now that we are familiar with SEO Tools, the target audience and offering, 
we are looking at the needs users may have. 
Following, you can find the users' stories covering the main users' needs.

### Visitor goals

**User stories**  

| User stories                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| As a user, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site  |
| As a user, I want to be able to scrape a webpage                     |
| As a user, I want to get a list of SEO on page elements              |
| As a user, I want to get a list of all the webpage headings          |
| As a user, I want to get a list of all of the schema types on a page |
| As a user, I want to get a list of all the links on a webpage        |
| As a user, I want to be able to make another scrape easily           |
| As a user, I want to be able to copy the results                     |

## Features

In the following paragraphs, we are going to see what features appear on the
application and where they meet the users' needs.

### Global features

1.	**Input url**  
    A field to let the user enter a url to scrape.

    ![Input url](./README-files/input-url.png)

2.	**URL validatior**  
    A logic that validates the url entered. The program has 4 different types of 
    validation:
    - Checks whether there are whitespaces at the beginning and end of the 
    entered url and strips them
    - Checks whether there are uppercase letters and lowercase them.
    - Checks whether the entered url has an http scheme. If not, the program
    adds it automatically.
    - checks whether the url is well formatted.
    - checks whether the url is accessible.
    - checks whether the url exists at all.

    ![Validator](./README-files/validator.png)

3.	**Redirection checker**  
    The redirection checker send an http requests and get the final url of 
    the request sent. The webpage scraped will the the final url after all of
    the redirects.

    ![Redirects](./README-files/redirects-checker.png)

4.	**Options selection**  
    As mentioned, the program allows the user to run 4 tasks:
    1. Get the SEO on page elements
    2. Get a list of headings with their tags.
    3. Get the page schema markup.
    4. Get all the page links.

    To run all of the above tasks, the final url (user input + redirects) is 
    used.

    ![Options selection](./README-files/options-selection.png)

    **1. On page elements**  
    Option 1. The program looks for the following elements:
    - user input url
    - final url after redirects
    - webpage title tag
    - webpage meta description
    - webpage robots tag
    - webpage canonical tag
    - webpage hreflang tags

    The program also calculates:
    - title tag length
    - meta description length

    If any of the above elements isn't available, a custom message will appear
    instead of the actual element.

    The result, is a well formatted printed output easy to copy and past.

    ![SEO elements](./README-files/seo-elements.png)

5.	**2. Headings list**  
    Option 2. The program scraper the webpage and get a list of all the headings
    with related tags. If the headings aren't available, a custom message will
    be printed instead.

    ![Headings](./README-files/headings.png)

6.	**3. Schema mark up**  
    Option 3. The program return a list of the schema mark up types used on the
    page. Since there are different ways to add a schema markup on a webpage, 
    the program is limited to 1 (the main) way. 
    
    In any other case a custom message will appear on the screen. 
    In future releases more ways to scrape json files can be added.

    ![Schema](./README-files/schema.png)

7.	**4. On page links**  
    Option 4. The program returns a list of all the links on the page. This 
    list can be used for internal linking analysis.

    ![On page links](./README-files/links.png)

    "#" and "/" are not errors:
    - "#" is used in href tags to self link a page, to not open a new page (in
    dropdown menus for example).
    - "/" is a link to the homepage (links can be absolute or relative. 
    Relative links to the homepage will only appear as "/". 
    In future developments, a logic to transform all the relative links in
    absolute links can be developed.)

8.	**New url**  
     At the end of any of the 4 tasks, the program asks to enter "new" if the 
     users is willing to scrape a new url.

     In future developments a logic to add the 3 options that haven't been
     run for the same url can be added together with the "new" option.

    ![Enter new](./README-files/enter-new.png)

## Where user stories meet features

In the following paragraph, Iâ€™m going to match features with user needs (user stories). 
The features are numbered and the same feature numbers appear in the table below.

| User stories                                                         | Features |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| As a user, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site  | 1        |
| As a user, I want to be able to scrape a webpage                     | 1,2,3    |
| As a user, I want to get a list of SEO on page elements              | 4        |
| As a user, I want to get a list of all the webpage headings          | 5        |
| As a user, I want to get a list of all of the schema types on a page | 6        |
| As a user, I want to get a list of all the links on a webpage        | 7        |
| As a user, I want to be able to make another scrape easily           | 8        |
| As a user, I want to be able to copy the results                     | 8        |

## Future implementation
In the future releases, the following features can be added:
1. More ways to scrape schema markup
2. More options to run other tasks at the end of a task
3. A sitemap generator
4. A logic to trasnform relative urls in absolute urls in task 3.

## Wireframes

The program has been develped with the following logic in mind.

This was a first draft. Evety node runs multiple subtasks to complete the task.

![Logic](./README-files/logic.png)

- **Calculator & Application form**  
I had the idea of adding a calculator and an application form while WIP so wireframes aren't available.

## Features left to implement 

- Little info boxes can be added next to each input field to clarify why that information is needed.
- Additional fields can be added to the calculator to make it more advanced. An 'extra fields' dropdown could reveal more input fields and so give users the option to use the short calculator or the advanced calculator.
- More questions can be added to the questionnaire: there are life insurance policies that haven't been covered such as the serious illness cover. More questions can be asked to the users to give an even more specific result.
- Calculators for mortgage protection and income protection can also be created.
- Preselected cover type input fields can be added to the application form. The field will be preselected to the cover type users need based on their questionnaire results.

## Design

In the following paragraph, I'm going to explain the colours, typography and imagery choices.

### Colours

The main colour used is a shade of blue (Liberty). Blue is a calm and serene colour. It is often associated with stability and reliability. Most of the insurance companies I can think of have at least one shade of blue in their colour palette (Allianz, Aviva, Axa, Zurich to name a few) and so Insured had to have a blue too. I've increased a bit the contrast ratio with light backgrounds to achieve accessibility best scores.

As I chose Liberty, I needed an opposite colour to create contrast with important elements on the page, such as the buttons. So, I picked a shade of red, Fuzzy Wuzzy and increased its contrast ratio with light colours to pass accessibility tests.

As secondary colours, I've used a shade of green (Verdigris) to highlight the past questions in the progress bar, and a tan colour used for smaller decorative purposes. I've also added  Timberwolf in case I needed a light grey but I haven't used it. May become useful for future development. 

![Color Palette](./README-files/insured-color-palette.png)

All the text colour combinations have been tested for accessibility and they all achieve WCAG AAA.
- [Colour contrast test: white on red](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/?fcolor=FFFFFF&bcolor=A42D2D) - Used on buttons.  
- [Colour contrast test: black on light blue](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/?fcolor=000000&bcolor=F3F4FA) - Used on the main text area.  
- [Colour contrast test: blue on light blue](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/?fcolor=3B4D97&bcolor=F3F4FA) - Used on headings.  

Tested with [Contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

### Typography

The typography was chosen for my liking. Open Sans is a very popular font if not the most popular.

I used [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) for all body elements.  

The fallback font used is Helvetica for all body elements.

### Imagery

I've used graphics for the logo, favicon and the navigation process. The navigation graphics come from [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/).

I've used SVG images where possible that are lighter than jpg and since it's a vector format, graphics always look sharp. It works well with logos and 'flat' graphics.

## Accessibility

As mentioned above, all the colour combinations used for text passed a contrast ratio test. During the testing phase, the white fonts on the red backgrounds (only used to style buttons) resulted low in contrast ratio. The red colour was adjusted to pass and achieve an accessibility score of WCAG AAA.

I've also used alt tags to describe images and aria labels to describe links.  
The pages have been structured using semantic HTML markup.  

The Lighthouse accessibility test also reports an accessibility score of 100/100. 

A Lighthouse report is available in a few paragraphs below in the testing section.

## SEO

Keywords have been used in the headings of the questionnaire start page and life insurance calculator page. Each page addresses a specific search intent:
- On the questionnaire page, the need of knowing whether a life insurance cover is needed
- the calculator page, the need for a life cover calculator
- The application form, the need of getting a cover painlessly

The title tags also include target keywords and the length displays in full on Google Search. Tested with this [title tag length checker](https://www.highervisibility.com/seo/tools/serp-snippet-optimizer/).

I've included the most common metadata (description, keywords, index) and a self-referring `rel=canonical` link on each page.

I've included Open Graph tags to control the pages' appearance when shared on social media as posts.

The Lighthouse SEO test also reports a score of 100/100. 

A Lighthouse report is available a few paragraphs below in the testing section.

2. [CSS validation](#css-validation)
3. [JavaScript validation](#js-validation)
4. [Functionality testing](#functionality-testing)
5. [Browsers compatibility](#browser-compatibility)
6. [Responsiveness testing](#responsiveness-testing)
7. [Lighthouse testing](#lighthouse-testing)
8. [User stories testing](#user-stories-testing)

### HTML validation

All the pages passed the HTML validation with no errors or warnings.
- [index.html](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fjannis-kiriasis.github.io%2Finsured%2Findex.html)  
![index.html html test](./README-files/questionnaire-html.png)
- [life-insurance-calculator.html](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fjannis-kiriasis.github.io%2Finsured%2Flife-insurance-calculator.html)  
![life-insurance-calculator.html test](./README-files/calculator-html.png)
- [application-form.html](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fjannis-kiriasis.github.io%2Finsured%2Fapplication-form.html)  
![application-form.html test](./README-files/application-html.png)

### CSS validation

Style.css passed the CSS validation with no errors.
- [css validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fjannis-kiriasis.github.io%2Finsured%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)  
![CSS validation](./README-files/css-test.png)

There are only 2 warnings related to `-webkit-appearance: none;` and `-moz-appearance: none;` used to style the form submit button. This was used to prevent iPhone / iPad default style. The submit button would otherwise not be styled as declared in the CSS without the webkit extension.

### JS validation 
The JavaScript files have been passed through [Jshint](https://jshint.com/): I have added a few semicolumns and removed unused variables. There are no issues with the code.

There are also no errors in the Console (Google Developer Tools).

The Lighthouse best practices test also reports a score of 100/100. 

A Lighthouse report is available a few paragraphs below in the testing section.

### Functionality testing

I've tested that the different functionalities of the website work as intended.

## Issues fixed

1. Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'onclick'): I was using a function that I actually didn't need. I removed the function and the issue was gone.
2. Cannot read properties of null (reading 'classList'): I was trying to add a class property to an element that didn't exist (past questions). In my `progressUpdate()` function a past question exists only if runningQuestion is in `runningQuestion[1]`, while in `runningQuestion[0]` past questions don't exists since `runningQuestion[0]` is the first question. So with an if stamement I made the code generating the error, running only if `runningQuestion !== 0`. This worked.
3. Override iPhone / iPad default styling of submit button. The button isn't styled as declared in the CSS. Solution: add to the class .button `-webkit-appearance: none;`. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5438567/css-submit-button-weird-rendering-on-ipad-iphone).
4. On mobile yes / no buttons were retaining the :hover styling after being clicked. I made the hover styling exist only for devices where hover is real with a media query. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23885255/how-to-remove-ignore-hover-css-style-on-touch-devices).


## Deployment

I've deployed the website on GitHub Pages. The website was developed on Gitpod and pushed to its GitHub repository using git command lines in the terminal. Every time a commit pushed to the website's repository updates the HTML and CSS files, GitHub Pages automatically updates the live demo.
To deploy the website:
1. from the GitHub repository, click on 'settings'
2. find and click on 'pages' on the setting sidebar menu
3. select the branch to be used. In this case 'main'
4. Refresh the page and in a few minutes, the following message will appear if the website was deployed correctly
![website published](./README-files/published-github-pages.png)

To clone the website:
1. Go to the GitHub repository [Insured](https://github.com/jannis-kiriasis/insured)
2. Open the dropdown 'Code'
3. Copy the given url (https://github.com/jannis-kiriasis/insured.git)
4. Open 'Git Bash' on your favourite code editor and select the location where you want to save the cloned directory
5. Type `git clone https://github.com/jannis-kiriasis/insured.git` and press enter to create a local copy

## Acknowledgements

I'm an SEO specialist working for an insurance company in Dublin. So I have some experience with Google tools and marketing life insurance policies to people.

Brian Macharia, my mentor, helped me test the website functionalities and provide excellent recommendations.

I've followed [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49pYIMygIcU&t=2066s) by Code Explained to create the logic to loop through the questions and create the progress bar (`progressUpdate()`, `nextQuestion()`, `leftQuestions()` and related event listeners and varibles). I've edited the code to fit this website.

I've used [this guide](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-dom/javascript-form-validation/) published on javascripttutorial.net to create part of the username input validation logic. The code was edited to fit this website.

I've used [this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17616624/detect-if-string-contains-any-spaces) to detect if the username input value contains any white spaces.

To create the README.md file I've used a previously created by me README.md [digibooking README.md](https://github.com/jannis-kiriasis/digibooking/blob/main/README.md) and updated it as needed.
